# StitchPay Application - Working State Documentation
# May 16, 2025

## Current Application Status

The StitchPay application is now in a fully working state with all critical features functioning correctly:

1. **Purchase Order Creation**: Users can create new purchase orders with customer information, line items, and due dates.
2. **Status Editing**: Purchase order status can be updated between "paid", "unpaid", and "cancelled" states.
3. **Dashboard Display**: The dashboard correctly shows summary statistics and recent purchase orders.
4. **Database Schema**: The database includes all required fields, including the due_date column.

## Fixed Issues

Throughout the development process, we resolved several issues:

1. **Circular Import Problems**: Eliminated circular imports by reorganizing the mail module initialization in the backend.
2. **Due Date Handling**: Fixed issues with date parsing and storage in the database.
3. **Purchase Order Creation**: Corrected data format and handling between frontend and backend.
4. **Status Updates**: Fixed issues with updating purchase order status.
5. **Dashboard Rendering**: Made the dashboard more resilient to handle missing or invalid data.
6. **Print Functionality**: Fixed issues with print preview, removed logo from print output, and ensured proper formatting of printed purchase orders.
7. **Backend Server Integration**: Ensured the Flask backend server runs properly in the packaged application using Waitress WSGI server.

## How to Run the Application

1. **Start the Backend**:
   ```powershell
   Set-Location -Path "K:\AI-Projects\stitchpay\backend"

   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   ```powershell
   Set-Location -Path "K:\AI-Projects\stitchpay"
   npm run dev
   ```
