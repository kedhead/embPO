You need to create or download an icon file (icon.ico) for your StitchPay application and place it in this directory.

The icon file should be in .ico format and ideally include multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128).

Several online tools can convert PNG images to ICO format with multiple sizes, such as:
